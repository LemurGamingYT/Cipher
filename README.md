# Cipher
 A Programming Language Made In Golang/Go

---
**Cipher** is a simple programming language,
aimed to match the *simplicity* of Python but *perform faster*.

Cipher is **~1.3x** as fast as Python as of **version 3.11.2** on my testing.

---
### How To Run

- Go to the 'Build' folder and run Cipher.exe from the command line
- example to run the examples: `Cipher>Build\Cipher.exe Examples/test.cpr`
(or run the runtest.bat)
